Hangman1.0 Doesn't work with 2 of the same character unless it is consecutive.
You can keep inputting the same letter .

Hangman2.0 I just tested functions,but lives doesn't work, and you can keep
inputting the same letter, but added replayability!

Hangman3.0 Fixed all issues. Any word should work.
(Doesn't need the def functions. Just for practice.)

Hangman4.0 Has not been started.
